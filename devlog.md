# Fall 2024 - Intro to Game Design @ SUNY New Paltz
* Name: Casey Reardon
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Avqr8HAu)
* [Proposal](proposal.pdf)
* [Itch.io](https://deadname-th.itch.io/gamedev-project)

### 2024-09-24 - 3hr: repo, devlog, trello, itch.io.
* Created github repo
* Added devlog.md and proposal.pdf
* Made trello page
* Exported the game and uploaded to itch.io, playable in browser.

## 2024-10-03 - 2hr: imported Brackey's platformer template
* Re-watched the Brackey tutorial. I thought I would better absorb the information on a second watch, and I think it worked.
* Added the platformer to this project. Will be heavily modified in the future, of course.
* Fixed the killzone not working as intended.
* Adjusted movement speed and jump height.

## 2024-10-06 - 2hr: Watched the GDQuest video
* Watched the GDQuest top-down shooter video. 
* While I am not making a top-down shooter, a lot of the information in the video is still relevant to me such as enemies that follow the player, healthbars, and the weapon that fires projectiles.
* The weapon in the video is coded to aim at enemies automatically. I will need to find out how to have it aim at the cursor.

## 2024-10-07 - 2.5hr: Added shooting mechanic
* Added a weapon that rotates around the player. The weapon looks at the mouse.
* Added a projectile that fires out of the weapon upon pressing left click. The projectile is moved at a constant speed based on the rotation of the gun
 and despawns after a set distance or upon hitting terrain.
* Created very simple pixel art sprites for the gun and bullet using [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/draw). All current visuals may be subject to change. 
* Used the [GDQuest top-down shooter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU&list=WL&index=84) and
 [this video on creating a shooting mechanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqzpx2f4X6Q) as references.
* Adjusted movement speed again.
