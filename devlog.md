# Fall 2024 - Intro to Game Design @ SUNY New Paltz
* Name: Casey Reardon
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Avqr8HAu)
* [Proposal](proposal.pdf)
* [Itch.io](https://deadname-th.itch.io/gamedev-project)

### 2024-09-24 - 3hr: repo, devlog, trello, itch.io.
* Created github repo
* Added devlog.md and proposal.pdf
* Made trello page
* Exported the game and uploaded to itch.io, playable in browser.

## 2024-10-03 : 2hr: imported Brackey's platformer template
* Re-watched the Brackey tutorial. I thought I would better absorb the information on a second watch, and I think it worked.
* Added the platformer to this project. Will be heavily modified in the future, of course.
* Fixed the killzone not working as intended.
* Adjusted movement speed and jump height.
